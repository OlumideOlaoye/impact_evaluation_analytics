As a Data Analyst in a not-for-profit international education organization, I utilized historical data of the Bridge Kenya Programme to assess the impact of the program in 111 schools, in 7 provinces across 31 regions in Kenya. The data was for over 13,000 pupils  from grades 1-5 from the end of an undisclosed school term in the past five years.
